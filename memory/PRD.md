# Appeal Case Manager — Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
Building "Appeal Case Manager" to assist with criminal appeals across Australian jurisdictions. Features secure document management, AI-powered case analysis, and a tiered reporting system (Free, $150 Full Detailed, $200 Extensive Log, and a locked Barrister View).

## Core Requirements
- **Report Tiers:** Strictly scale in depth. Free (Base) -> $150 (2x depth) -> $200 (3x depth)
- **Barrister View:** Locked until all 3 standard reports are generated/paid
- **Report Language:** STRICT third-person educational tool. No "we", "us", "our", "you", "your"
- **Branding:** Forced light mode. High contrast. Blue/slate/navy only. Action buttons bright blue with white text
- **Legal Accuracy:** Must cite current, state-specific, and federal Australian legislation
- **Unified Document Styling:** Times New Roman, 12pt body, bold headings, indented bullets, legal footers
- **Australian English:** ALL user-facing text must use Australian spelling. auSpelling utility applied to all AI-generated content.

## Architecture
- React frontend + FastAPI backend + MongoDB
- AI: OpenAI GPT-4o via Emergent LLM Key
- Auth: Emergent-managed Google Auth + email/password
- Payments: PayID (sole payment method — PayPal/Stripe fully removed)
- Emails: Resend

## Completed — Previous Session (10 Apr 2026)
- Fixed Grounds of Merit UI: Reduced mobile fonts, displayed actual Legal Framework text
- Applied auSpelling to ALL AI-generated content (deep analysis, evidence, appellate pathway, timeline)
- Expanded auSpelling utility with 15+ additional Australian English conversions
- Fixed Barrister report card: forced inline `style={{color:'#ffffff'}}` for bright white text on teal
- Fixed Google Sign In: Changed from `<button onClick>` to `<a href>` for iOS webview compatibility
- Full forensic codebase audit (dead code, lint, duplication, MongoDB _id fixes)
- Removed PayPal/Stripe completely; PayID is sole payment method

- **Backend Refactoring (server.py decomposition):**
  - `server.py`: 6,068 → 426 lines (93% reduction)
  - Extracted to 6 focused modules:
    - `services/report_quality.py` (453 lines) — text normalisation, dedup, forensic language
    - `services/pipeline_orchestrator.py` (529 lines) — pipeline freshness, document extraction
    - `services/report_generator.py` (1,847 lines) — `analyze_case_with_ai` engine
    - `services/barrister_generator.py` (1,092 lines) — barrister brief generation
    - `routers/reports.py` (812 lines) — report CRUD endpoints
    - `routers/report_exports.py` (1,047 lines) — PDF/DOCX export endpoints
  - All 19 regression tests passed. Zero regressions.
- **Camera/Share Native Features**: Already fully implemented (DocumentScanner.jsx, native/camera.js, native/share.js, export share flow). Verified correct.
- **Forensic Australian English Language Audit:**
  - Fixed 10 hardcoded American English strings in API endpoints, response fields, function/prop names, and data-testid attributes
  - API endpoints renamed: `/timeline/analyze` → `/timeline/analyse`, `/analyze-contradictions` → `/analyse-contradictions`
  - Response fields: `documents_analyzed` → `documents_analysed`, `analyzed_at` → `analysed_at`, `total_cases_analyzed` → `total_cases_analysed`
  - Fixed `judgment` → `judgement` in models, LLM prompts, legal disclaimers, and frontend pages
  - Added **52 new AU spelling conversions** to both frontend (`auSpelling.js`) and backend (`normalise_au_spelling`) dictionaries covering: traumatise, victimise, scrutinise, marginalise, haemorrhage, anaesthetic, paediatric, judgement, manoeuvre, wilful, skilful, pretence, cancelled, labelled, ageing, fulfil, and more
  - Final scan: zero American English in any user-visible code (only JS API `behavior: "smooth"` which is mandatory)
