# Appeal Case Manager — Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
Build "Appeal Case Manager" to assist with criminal appeals across Australian jurisdictions. Features: secure document management, AI-powered case analysis, tiered reporting system (Free Quick Summary, $150 Full Detailed, $200 Extensive Log, locked Appellate Research Brief).

## Core Requirements
- **Report Tiers:** Strictly scale in depth. Appellate Research Brief is capstone synthesis.
- **Report Language:** STRICT third-person educational tool. No "we", "us", "our", "you", "your". Forensic appellate language.
- **Branding:** Forced light mode globally. High contrast only. No amber/brown (blue/slate/navy). Bright blue action buttons with white text.
- **Print/Export:** Exacting standards for footer, TOC, paragraph numbering, layout parity between on-screen and exported (PDF/Word/Print).
- **Australian English:** analyse, organise, judgement, offence throughout.
- **Independence:** All Emergent branding / auth / LLM proxy dependencies removed — app runs on user's personal OpenAI key and direct Google OAuth.

## Architecture
- Frontend: React + Tailwind + Shadcn/UI
- Backend: FastAPI + MongoDB
- AI: OpenAI GPT-4o directly via user's personal API key (no Emergent proxy)
- Auth: Direct Google OAuth (state+localStorage+cookie CSRF protection)
- Email: Resend
- Payments: PayID
- Mobile: Capacitor (native app build finalised)

## Key Files
- `/app/backend/offence_framework.py` — 3,950+ line forensic legal dictionary (all 8 states + Cth, 18 offence categories, mens rea + 13-stage procedural flow)
- `/app/backend/services/offence_helpers.py` — LLM context builder
- `/app/frontend/src/utils/exportHtml.js` — Shared export CSS/HTML wrapper
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/BarristerView.jsx` — Appellate Research Brief view + custom export builder
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/ReportView.jsx` — Standard report view + custom export builder
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/CaseDetail.jsx` — Case detail with Print All/PDF All/Word All + Progress export
- `/app/frontend/src/components/ExportOptionsModal.jsx` — section picker for exports
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/SignupSourceAnalytics.jsx` — conversion tracking dashboard

- **UI bug fixes** — 5 broken Google-login CTA buttons + CaseChat UI overlap

### Completed (14 February 2026 — Legal Framework Gap Fill)
- **Terrorism state coverage** — added NSW/VIC/QLD/SA/WA/TAS/NT/ACT terrorism police-powers & preventative-detention Acts with Cth cross-reference stubs
- **Organised_crime completeness** — filled TAS (Police Offences Act 1935), NT (Serious Crime Control Act 2009), ACT (Crimes (Criminal Organisations Control) Act 2012); added Cth Criminal Code Div 390
- **Cth gap fills** — added Commonwealth entries for `extortion_blackmail` (Criminal Code s.138-139), `arson_property_damage` (Crimes Act 1914 s.29, Criminal Code Pt 7.8), `domestic_violence` (Family Law Act 1975 Pt VII Div 11, Criminal Code s.474.17), `public_order` (Criminal Code Pt 9.1, Crimes Act 1914 s.76/89), `robbery_theft` (Criminal Code Ch 7 Pt 7.2 Div 131-134)
- **13-stage forensic procedural flow** (`INDICTABLE_PROCEDURE_FLOW`, `HYBRID_PROCEDURE_FLOW`, `SUMMARY_PROCEDURE_FLOW`) — Incident → Arrest → Charge → Bail → First Mention → Committal → Indictment → Trial Prep → Trial → Verdict → Sentencing → Intermediate Appeal → High Court s.35A special leave. Every category now carries the pipeline tailored to its offence class.
- **Mens rea framework** (`MENS_REA_FRAMEWORK`) — intention/knowledge/recklessness/negligence/strict/absolute with authorities (He Kaw Teh, Crabbe, Aubrey, Nydam, Lavender) and application examples. Each of 18 offence categories references its relevant fault elements.
- **Context builder upgrade** — `offence_helpers.py` now surfaces `RELEVANT MENS REA` and `FORENSIC PROCEDURAL PIPELINE` sections into LLM prompts per case.
- **Currency tracker** — `LEGISLATION_CURRENCY.last_verified = "2026-02-14"`.
- **Regression tests** — `tests/test_framework_gap_fill_20260214.py` (12 new tests) + full framework suite green (409 passed).

### Completed (14 February 2026 — P1 OpenAI Cost Tracking Dashboard)
- **AI Usage Tracker** (`/app/backend/services/ai_usage_tracker.py`) — estimates tokens via `tiktoken` o200k_base; applies OpenAI Feb 2026 rate card (gpt-4o $2.50/$10 per 1M in/out; gpt-4o-mini $0.15/$0.60 per 1M); extracts case_id + report_type from session_id conventions; writes fire-and-forget to `ai_usage` Mongo collection.
- **LLM instrumentation** — `call_llm_structured` in `services/llm_service.py` records usage on success (swallow-on-error; LLM flow never blocked).
- **Admin endpoint** — `GET /api/admin/openai-costs?period=month|week|all` returns totals (cost_usd, tokens, calls, success/fail), projected month-end USD, per-model / per-task / per-report-type / per-user breakdowns, and a daily series.
- **Frontend panel** (`/app/frontend/src/components/OpenAICostsPanel.jsx`) — mounted at top of `/admin/analytics`. Four stat cards (USD spent, projection, tokens, success rate), period selector (7-day / month / all), daily sparkline, three breakdown cards, top-users table, pricing note.
- **Regression tests** — `tests/test_ai_usage_tracker.py` (24 tests) covering pricing, token estimation, session-id extractors, DB write, and error-swallow contract.
- **Testing-agent verified** — iteration_207.json confirms 100% pass on backend (433/433 + 13 new endpoint tests) and 100% on frontend (panel + preserved signup-source analytics). Zero critical/minor bugs.

### Completed (14 February 2026 — P2 Refactor: Frameworks Package)
- **Split `offence_framework.py` (3,970 lines) into `/app/backend/frameworks/` package** (13 themed modules):
  - `jurisdictions.py`: `LEGISLATION_CURRENCY`, `AUSTRALIAN_STATES`
  - `procedure.py`: `INDICTABLE/HYBRID/SUMMARY_PROCEDURE_FLOW`, `MENS_REA_FRAMEWORK`
  - `offences.py`: `OFFENCE_CATEGORIES` (all 18)
  - `states.py`: NSW/VIC/QLD/SA/WA/TAS/NT/ACT `_CRIMINAL_FRAMEWORK`
  - `federal.py`: `FEDERAL_CRIMINAL_FRAMEWORK`, `FEDERAL_FAULT_ELEMENTS`, `PROCEEDS_OF_CRIME_FRAMEWORK`
  - `appeal.py`: `APPEAL_FRAMEWORK`, `APPEAL_GROUNDS_ACCESSIBILITY`
  - Plus `common_grounds.py`, `human_rights.py`, `recent_updates.py`, `sentencing.py`, `evidence.py`, `mental_impairment.py`, `landmark_cases.py`
- **Back-compat shim** — `offence_framework.py` reduced from 3,970 → 10 lines; re-exports everything via `from frameworks import *`. All existing imports (`from offence_framework import OFFENCE_CATEGORIES` etc.) continue to work unchanged across routers/services/tests.
- **Identity-preserving** — all 27 public symbols are the SAME object via both import paths.
- **Regression tests** — `tests/test_frameworks_refactor.py` (5 tests) lock in import parity, star-import behaviour, and data integrity.
- **Full suite green** — 446 passed / 2 skipped across all framework + AI usage + refactor tests.

### Completed (14 February 2026 — Translate reliability + Admin UX + Cost per Brief)
- **Translate concurrency** — `routers/translate.py` `_run_translation_background` now uses `asyncio.Semaphore(3)` so chunks translate in parallel. Regression test proves 6 chunks complete in <0.9s (vs 1.2s sequential) — meaningful 3× wall-time reduction without tripping OpenAI rate limits.
- **Translate restart-recovery** — new `_persist_task()` mirrors task state to Mongo `translation_tasks` collection; `/translate/status` falls back to Mongo when in-memory `_translate_tasks` is empty (simulates backend restart). Returns `recovered: true` flag so the UI knows state was recovered.
- **Translate frontend polling** — `ReportTranslator.jsx` bumped `maxAttempts` from 120 → 300 and `pollInterval` from 4s → 5s (25-minute ceiling instead of 8 minutes). Handles Appellate Research Briefs with 15–25 chunks comfortably.
- **Admin Dashboard reorder** — PayID Pending Payments section moved to the TOP of `/admin` (above Live Visitor Statistics) so new transfers are the first thing seen.
- **AI Cost Badge (friendly nudge)** — new `GET /api/cases/{case_id}/ai-cost` endpoint (owner-only) + `<AiCostBadge>` component mounted above the Reports tab on `/cases/:id`. Shows "Estimated AI cost: $X.XX across N AI calls" + per-report-type pills. Silent when no usage has been recorded yet (intentional — older cases show nothing until new AI calls run).
- **Cost tracker regex fix** — `_extract_case_id` / `_extract_report_type` in `ai_usage_tracker.py` now support the production `case_<12hex>` case_id format (e.g. `case_ec9b7141be1b`) alongside legacy UUIDs.
- **Regression tests** — `tests/test_translate_parallel_recovery.py` (3 tests) + expanded `tests/test_ai_usage_tracker.py` (now 31 parametrised cases).
- **Testing-agent verified** — iteration_208.json confirms 400/400 key tests pass, zero critical/minor bugs, all data-testids present.

### Completed (14 February 2026 — Section-only Translate + Third-party Independence Cleanup)
- **Translate a single section** — new `POST /api/cases/{case_id}/translate-section` endpoint (synchronous, cached). Body: `{report_id, language, section_heading, section_text}`. Validates: unsupported language (400), empty text (400), >30k chars (400), report-not-in-case (404), LLM failure (502). English no-op short-circuits. Cache collection: `report_section_translations`.
- **SectionTranslatableReport component** — splits markdown on H2 headings and adds a "Translate section" dropdown next to each heading with 20 languages. Translated text renders in a blue-bordered callout below the original with a "Hide" link. Coexists with the existing full-report `<ReportTranslator>`.
- **8 unit tests** (`tests/test_translate_section.py`) covering every error path and the cache short-circuit. Testing-agent verified iteration_209 — 18/18 backend tests + full frontend data-testid verification.
- **Emergent-independence cleanup** (user runs on their own domain `criminallawappealmanagement.com.au`, own Google OAuth client, own OpenAI billing):
  - Removed legacy `/api/auth/session` endpoint body that called `demobackend.emergentagent.com` — endpoint now returns 410 Gone cleanly.
  - Removed the `legacySessionId` fallback branch from `frontend/src/App.js` OAuth callback handler.
  - Replaced `EMERGENT_LLM_KEY` fallback in `services/llm_service.py` and `config.py` with a hard requirement on `OPENAI_API_KEY` — missing key aborts startup.
  - Updated `server.py` deep-health endpoint + `services/report_generator.py` to read `OPENAI_API_KEY` directly.
  - Deleted legacy integration test scripts (`tests/legacy/*`) that still referenced the old preview URL.
  - All remaining comments explicitly describe the self-hosted architecture on the owner's domain.
- **Result**: grep for "Emergent" across `/app/backend` and `/app/frontend/src` returns ZERO hits outside the `emergentintegrations` Python SDK import (just a library wrapper around the OpenAI SDK — no proxy, no shared key).

### Completed (14 February 2026 — Legislation Currency Monitoring + Friendly Nudges)
- **Legislation registry** (`/app/backend/frameworks/legislation_registry.py`) — 79 Australian Acts catalogued across NSW (13), VIC (10), QLD (9), SA (9), WA (9), TAS (8), NT (8), ACT (8), Cth (5). Each entry has direct AustLII URL + AustLII search fallback + `last_verified` ISO date. (`/app/backend/frameworks/legislation_registry.py`) — 79 Australian Acts catalogued across NSW (13), VIC (10), QLD (9), SA (9), WA (9), TAS (8), NT (8), ACT (8), Cth (5). Each entry has direct AustLII URL + AustLII search fallback + `last_verified` ISO date.
- **Currency dashboard service** (`/app/backend/services/legislation_currency.py`) — age bucketing (🟢 <90d current, 🟡 90–180d review soon, 🔴 >180d overdue), Mongo `framework_audit_log` collection mirrors manual ticks, dashboard prefers the later of registry date or audit-log date.
- **Three new admin endpoints** (`/app/backend/routers/admin.py`):
  - `GET /api/admin/legislation-currency` — returns full dashboard with per-Act rows, totals, and a forensic notice card
  - `POST /api/admin/legislation-currency/mark-verified` — user-initiated tick after manual AustLII review
  - `POST /api/admin/legislation-currency/ai-check` — heavily-guardrailed GPT-4o cross-check
- **HEAVY ANTI-HALLUCINATION guardrails** on the AI check:
  - Strict JSON schema enforcement: `status` ∈ {appears_current, possible_change, cannot_verify, outside_knowledge_cutoff}; `confidence` ∈ {low, medium, high}; `knowledge_cutoff`, `forensic_summary`, `suggested_review_focus[]`, `flagged_amendments[]`, `forensic_caveat` all required
  - Validator (`_validate_ai_response`) rejects: missing keys, invalid enums, non-list fields, generic filler ("as an AI", "I'm sorry", "Lorem ipsum"), first-person pronouns (i/we/you/us/our), short summaries (<15 chars)
  - On any validation failure, the AI content is SUPPRESSED and the response becomes `{ok:false, guardrail:"schema_violation"|"llm_failure", error, forensic_caveat}` — potentially-fabricated text NEVER reaches the UI
  - On validation pass, the service OVERWRITES the model's `forensic_caveat` with authoritative wording that explicitly states this is a prompt for manual review, not verification
  - The dashboard NEVER updates `last_verified` from AI output — only manual `/mark-verified` ticks count, by design
- **Admin dashboard page** (`/app/frontend/src/pages/LegislationCurrency.jsx`) — forensic notice card at top, jurisdiction filter, per-Act rows with AustLII links, "Mark verified" (prompts for forensic note), "AI check" (opens dialog with amber "PROMPT FOR MANUAL REVIEW — NOT VERIFICATION" banner; shows red "Guardrail tripped — output suppressed" when anti-hallucination tripwire fires)
- **Admin dashboard header** — new "Legislation Currency" + "Signup Source Analytics" links + friendly-nudge self-hosted footer ("Self-hosted · your OpenAI key · your Google OAuth · criminallawappealmanagement.com.au")
- **Framework version badge on exports** (`/app/frontend/src/utils/exportHtml.js`) — every PDF/Word/Print export now includes "Legal Framework v2026.02 · 79 Australian Acts manually verified · criminallawappealmanagement.com.au" in the footer branding block
- **Self-hosting deployment guide** (`/app/memory/SELF_HOSTING_GUIDE.md`) — step-by-step Railway walk-through for retiring the Emergent preview URL dependency
- **20 unit tests** (`tests/test_legislation_currency.py`) covering registry coverage, bucketing, all guardrail rejection paths, dashboard shape, mark_verified persistence. Testing-agent verified iteration_210 — 100% backend + frontend pass, zero critical/minor issues, all data-testids present, anti-hallucination guardrails confirmed working end-to-end.
- **README.md fully refreshed (14 Feb 2026)** — removed all references to the deprecated 2-page Appellate Research Brief Quick Brief, added new sections for Legislation Currency Dashboard (#11), Admin Dashboard & Analytics with OpenAI Cost Tracker (#16), and Anti-Hallucination & Forensic Language Rules. Renumbered sections 1–20. Updated backend routers, service layer, and frameworks package listings. Rewrote Security section with self-hosting independence block. Replaced Emergent references with explicit self-hosted architecture (owner's OpenAI key, Google OAuth client, domain `criminallawappealmanagement.com.au`).

### Completed (15 February 2026 — Legal Seal in Export Footers)
- **Navy/gold "FRAMEWORK VERIFIED" seal injected into PDF/Print footers** — both shared export builder (`/app/frontend/src/utils/exportHtml.js`) and the `ReportView.jsx` preview pipeline now emit a compact navy pill in the CSS Paged Media `@bottom-center` margin box, reading `✓  FRAMEWORK VERIFIED  ·  79 Australian Acts`. White 6.5pt serif text, 0.14em tracking, `#0b1e3f` background with `#1e3a8a` 0.5pt border, padded `2pt 8pt`, rounded `2pt`. Added to both `@page` (portrait) and `@page landscape-table` so the seal persists when tables flip landscape.
- **Layout parity preserved** — existing `@bottom-left` (italic document label + appellant) and `@bottom-right` (Page X of Y) are untouched; the seal sits centrally between them.
- **Visually verified** — rendered a sample A4 PDF via headless Chromium print pipeline with `emulate_media("print")`; file-analysis confirmed: italic label left, navy pill with white checkmark + "FRAMEWORK VERIFIED · 79 Australian Acts" centred, page number right. `-webkit-print-color-adjust: exact` ensures Chrome/Edge/Safari all honour the background fill.

### Completed (21 February 2026 — Canonical Print Spec Locked Across All 7 Export Surfaces)
- **Single source of truth for print formatting** — owner agreed a canonical print spec and every export builder now uses identical values: body 11pt Times New Roman / line-height 1.5 / H1 14pt bold / H2 12pt bold / H3 12pt bold italic / paragraph-gap 10pt / margins 18mm top, 20mm sides, 22mm bottom. Mobile @media keeps the same canonical sizes for WYSIWYG parity (only container padding shrinks).
- **Footer spec locked** — `{Appellant} · {Doc Type} · {Date in en-AU long form}` left + `Page X of Y` right, 9pt Times italic, on EVERY export. Legacy "Criminal Law Appeal Management / Doc — Defendant — Date" prefix removed. Also removed the `@bottom-center` FRAMEWORK VERIFIED placard per owner's strict two-box footer spec.
- **Files updated with canonical CSS** (6 frontend + 1 backend):
  1. `/app/frontend/src/utils/exportHtml.js` — shared builder (Notes, Legal Framework, Progress, Full Bundle)
  2. `/app/frontend/src/pages/CaseDetail.jsx` — `buildTabPreviewHtml` (Documents tab + all-tab exports)
  3. `/app/frontend/src/components/GroundsOfMerit.jsx` — `buildGroundsPreviewHtml` (bulk) + `buildSingleGroundHtml` (per-ground)
  4. `/app/frontend/src/components/TimelineEnhanced.jsx` — timeline export (single @page rule; dedup removed)
  5. `/app/frontend/src/pages/BarristerView.jsx` — Appellate Research Brief export
  6. `/app/frontend/src/pages/ReportView.jsx` — standard AI report print CSS
  7. `/app/backend/routers/report_exports.py` + `/app/backend/services/export_footer.py` — DOCX Heading 1/2/3 styles + PDF canvas footer + `build_footer_label`
- **Root-cause fix for giant whitespace gaps** — removed `page-break-before: always; page-break-after: always;` on `.section-body table` in both `ReportView.jsx` and `exportHtml.js`. This rule was forcing every table to a fresh page and leaving half-blank preceding pages (the exact bug Deb reported through 1100+ iterations). Tables now break naturally via the `page: landscape-table` named page without forced breaks.
- **orphans/widows protection** — every paragraph element has `orphans: 3; widows: 3` to stop headings/paragraphs being stranded.
- **Backend DOCX canonical** — Normal 11pt / line-spacing 1.5 / space-after 10pt; Heading 1 14pt bold; Heading 2 12pt bold navy; Heading 3 12pt bold italic navy. `build_footer_label` emits middle-dot format; PDF `NumberedCanvas` footer at 9pt italic 20mm margin-aligned.
- **Regression tests** — `tests/test_export_endpoints_iteration201.py` updated to assert the new canonical middle-dot format, 9pt (18 half-point) DOCX footer, and en-AU long-form date. 68 export/report/footer tests pass cleanly.
- **Visually verified** — canonical test HTML rendered via Playwright shows H1 bold, H2 with navy underline, H3 navy italic, justified body, clear 10pt paragraph gaps, no whitespace gaps.

## Remaining / Backlog
- **P1**: Verify direct `/export-pdf` and `/export-word` buttons bypass Safari iOS print headers correctly on a real device.
- **P2**: Second attachment for counsel conference prep on the Appellate Research Brief.
- **P2 (deferred)**: Founder video testimonial / explainer on the landing page to build trust.
- **P3**: When the user deploys the backend to Railway per `SELF_HOSTING_GUIDE.md`, flip `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` to `https://api.criminallawappealmanagement.com.au` — at that point the Emergent preview URL is no longer in any runtime path.
